NHL Attendance Map
This map is the compilation of the attendance record from each team over the course of 20 years.

Notes:
Las Vegas only has this past years attendance the rest were filled in so the propertional symbolism wouldn't be messed up.
I would like to fix it so that 0 values do not show up when creating them in the future if possible.
